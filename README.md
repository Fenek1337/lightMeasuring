# lightMeasuring
This the repository of our project which focuses on light measuring. It's based on sixteen light sensors and some kind of main computer, where we can display results of measurements. Our goal is to make sensors wireless and then connect whole configuration with existing [KNX](https://www.knx.org/knx-en/for-professionals/index.php) build.
